# Prompts

Put here the prompts you use for any LLM-based compliance checks or situation classifiers.

Suggested names:
- `compliance_check.txt` or `compliance_check.md` — prompt for classifying or scoring conversations for compliance.
- `situation_classifier.txt` — prompt for detecting product loss vs substandard service vs other.

Include a short note in `docs/` on how you designed these prompts (e.g. few-shot examples, output format, guardrails).
