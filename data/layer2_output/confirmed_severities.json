These actions fall under the CRITICAL severity level as they directly violate R001, which prohibits threats of legal action unless authorized. The language used is not only demeaning but also escalates the situation to a severe level, justifying the higher severity classification.",

Additionally, the agent's dismissive and aggressive tone towards the customer's personal circumstances further exacerbates the severity of the violation, aligning with the criteria for a critical level as outlined in the severity definitions.",
